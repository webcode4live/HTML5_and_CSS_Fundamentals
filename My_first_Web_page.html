            Some poetry:
        </h1>
        <q>     
            Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,
            Drink up the monarch’s plague, this flattery?
            Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
            And that your love taught it this alchemy,
            
            To make of monsters and things indigest
            Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
            Creating every bad a perfect best,
            As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
            
            O! ’tis the first, ’tis flattery in my seeing,
            And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
            Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ‘greeing,
            And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
            
            If it be poisoned, ’tis the lesser sin
            That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
        </q>
